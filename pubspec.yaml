  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
     - assets/images/
  #  - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Quicksand
